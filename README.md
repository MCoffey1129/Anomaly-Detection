Anomaly Detection
===


In the attached code we will use the Iris dataset, we will relabel two Setosa entries as Versicolor
and check to see if the two Unsupervised learning models (K means clustering and Density based clustering method
(DBSCAN)) will detect the mis-labelled entries. Please note we would never assume that
any cases which are flagged from these models are anomalies without consulting with an expert in the field.
